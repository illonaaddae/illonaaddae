I’m the Founder and Executive Director at **Slint Tech** 🎖️ and a software engineer focused on harnessing technology to make significant impacts in the tech industry and building communities that embrace everyone regardless of background or gender.

## About Me
I believe in a world where opportunities are equal, dreams are boundless, and success is driven by determination, hard work, and talent, not defined by gender. And that technology should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their background. That's why I'm committed to empowering women and underrepresented groups to pursue careers in tech.

This ignited my passion for breaking barriers in tech and advocating for a more inclusive, diverse tech world.
